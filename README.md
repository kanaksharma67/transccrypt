## 🧩 Problem Statement  
**Problem Statement 6 –  *Better Finance for everone with Stellar*

---

## 🎯 Objective  
Millions of users in rural or low-network regions struggle with basic digital transactions due to poor or no internet connectivity. Our app, **Transcrypt**, aims to provide an **offline payment solution** that enables users to securely make peer-to-peer payments without requiring continuous internet. This addresses a critical gap in financial accessibility and inclusiveness, empowering users to make transactions even in remote areas.

### **Our  Approach:**  
- We chose this problem to tackle the real-world issue of financial exclusion in low-connectivity zones, aiming to bring a reliable and secure digital alternative to cash.  
- **Key challenges addressed:**  
  - Enabling **offline transaction protocols**  
  - Designing an intuitive **user interface** for tech-novice users  
  - Ensuring **security and validation** without online verification  
- We brainstormed the use of **Bluetooth/NFC/local mesh** for offline transfers and integrated an offline-first database model.  
- Future enhancements include real-time syncing on reconnection, currency conversion, and AI-driven fraud detection.

## ⛔ Existing Limitations

Traditional digital wallets often suffer from:

- **Constant internet requirement**  
  Transactions fail in rural areas, remote locations, or during travel when connectivity is poor.

- **No multi‑currency support or customizable splits**  
  You can’t automatically convert between currencies or split bills by arbitrary ratios (e.g., 20–30–50).

- **Lack of offline validation**  
  Without cryptographic offline signing, unconfirmed transactions can lead to disputes or fraud.

- **Centralized dependency**  
  Relying on centralized servers reduces transparency, creates single points of failure, and raises privacy concerns.

❗ **TRANScrypt** solves these by providing a decentralized, offline‑first payment experience with on‑chain settlement, multi‑currency conversion, and flexible bill‑splitting.
